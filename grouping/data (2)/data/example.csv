We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man. 

And we've tried. We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action, diversity quotas and scholarships that white people (even ones as poor or poorer) don't get. They don't want change. 

The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution. 

What do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in (and as a measurable consequence, an increase in crime)? 

The cause of their problems lie in two places: 

The actions of a misguided ""community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime

And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them. 

The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level. 

How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions, made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity, white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies.

It could be radiation. The CLOUD DID NOTHING TO BRUCE PHYSICALLY it is a mental imprint of a horrible incident on him. The only exposure he had when he was a kid was the one he was born with. The mushroom cloud is simply an incident wherein everyone was evacuated and only the base was destroyed. The reason Bruce was able to withstand the Gamma Ray burst which would have killed anyone else was because of the regenerative trait he was born with that was passed on by his father. 

I think you have real issues understanding non-standard narrative devices. No one was exposed to anything in that blast other than possible radioactive drift, unless they made it out of the exclusion zone. Or it wasn't even radioactive. Mushroom clouds can be caused by all kinds of explosions. 

He needed to cure his son because he never intended for his son to be a part of the experiment and he had no idea what it would do to Bruce. In the end the passed down trait saved Bruce from a Gamma Ray burst that would have surely killed him. I have no problem with them figuring out a way to make it marginally more believable why Bruce would survive that Gamma Ray burst as it would melt any person exposed to it. In fact even his friend shouldn't have survived.

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/introduction). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Telling people they're probably shit out of luck is a pretty common response in the sub, but that's largely because there are a lot of posts that warrant that response.  I employ a similar approach with my clients:  I don't sugarcoat anything, and I focus on what we *can* do.  Sometimes this is quite a bit, other times it's not much.  

I do agree with you though that snark, derision, and telling people they're wrong, happen more than necessary. Lurkers seem to upvote based on entertainment value, so judgmental replies can sometimes rise to the top.  I can definitely be guilty of some snark, but I always attempt to include helpful questions or comments alongside.  And sometimes you have to dig a bit deeper or wait around for something genuinely helpful.

[Here's a good recent example](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/33oc2p/trespassing_charges_from_an_officer_for_crossing) where the top-rated comment tells the guy he's guilty, and then the guy comes along later on to say that he successfully fought the ticket.

It said that 52.4% of hate crimes were committed by whites, and 24.3% were black. Whites are 77% of the American population, blacks are 13.2%. Whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the hate crime stats. This is pretty simple math.


There are 5814 offenders

52.4% is 3047 offenders rounding up to the next whole number

24.3% is 1412 offenders rounding up to the next whole number


There are 245,532,000 whites in America

There are 41,600,000 blacks in America


We can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get:

1 in every 80581 whites was charged with a hate crime in 2013

1 in every 29461 blacks was charged with a hate crime in 2013


This makes blacks 2.73 times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites, per capita.

Had a good chuckle with the responses here. They're absolutely right of course, but you have to wonder what the responses would have been had the genders been reversed - you being a girl with him going down on you constantly, but you refusing to give him a blowjob. I'd imagine folks left &amp; right would tell you that it's your body, your choice. That you don't have to do it if you're not comfortable with it. That if he can't accept that, he'd be a jerk for forcing it on you, and that he can just walk off a cliff, and stuff of that nature.

.

There was one similar post a few months back with just this scenario. Didn't end well, but the nature of the responses were more or less expected.

.

In your case, I'd start by apologizing for being selfish, and that you're absolutely willing to go for it. Tell her you're willing to do it, but slowly. Step by step. You want to give her the best possible experience possible, so you want to do it right the first time. Then follow up on it. You don't have to go full face in, start by going down while she's wearing thin pants. Then for the next session, let her wear yogapants and such. After you get used to it, change it to underwear. Ease off the pressure, take your time, and have fun. Tossing her salad is fun. Why do you think those girls in stock pics are always smiling eating their salads? Because their man tosses it first.",None,0,0,t3_34gjck

*Seriously* OP? You don't know why you told someone you were flirting with that you were single? You say you don't want to tell your wife because it will hurt her and you don't want to do that. If that's true, and you really do love her, then you need to sit her down and seriously work on getting into counselling (or at the very least talking together) about fixing whatever it is that you feel is wrong with your marriage. Don't make excuses like ""oh well, we just never followed through"". You need to put *effort* in if you want to make it work.


Now, if what you *really* want is to screw around on Tinder then stop telling yourself it's just innocent banter, stop telling yourself there's nothing wrong with what you're doing. Tell your wife the truth and break it off because you aren't do her a favor by staying with her if you're going to be cheating (physically OR emotionally). I get the feeling that this is NOT what you want, and if that's the case you need to stop doing this shit and start being honest with your wife, starting with this (because it's going to be a lot worse if that chick actually does tell her)

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), in which lymphocytic infiltration causes destruction of myelin and axons. During the initial stages, inflammation is temporary and the myelin sheath is able to regenerate, resulting in transient episodes of neurological disability. 

While the cause of MS is yet be established, there are proposed theories, which include genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, microbiological infections, and immunological lack of tolerance, leading to the development of the chronic inflammatory features of MS. 

Hypotheses on possible infections are supported by the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with increased risk of developing MS (Levin et al., 2003). Lang and colleagues (2002) proposed cross-reactivity of T-cell receptors (TCR) to DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) and DRB5*0101-restricted EBV peptide as the mechanism behind the increased risk. In addition to possible molecular mimicry, EBV infected B-cells have been found in the meninges and post-mortem brains of MS patients and not in other neurological inflammatory diseases (Serafini et al., 2007). 

The pathological processes of MS encompass inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, oligodendrocyte depletion, astrocytosis, neuron and axon degeneration, which ultimately result in the formation of sclerotic plaque in the CNS (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

Migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) is believed to initiate the disease process, though research attempts to identify whether the BBB is dysfunctional prior to immunocellular infiltration. Altered haemorheology, leading to ischemic injury of the cerebral microvasculature, has been proposed as a mechanism for BBB dysfunction (Ballabh, Braun, &amp; Nedergaard, 2004). The extravasation of the T lymphocytes is achieved through the interaction of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon γ (INF-γ) with endothelial adhesion molecules LFA-1 and VLA-4 (Engelhardt, 2006). Th17 lymphocytes may then secrete IL-17, under macrophage mediated IL-23 control, which together with lymphocytic IL-22 disrupts the BBB, allowing T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). While the antigenic target not fully established, it is likely the MBP and the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Moreover, an autoimmune response against the αB crystalline chaperone proteins prevents physiological suppression of cerebral inflammation (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008) and autoantibodies against neurofascin-155 and neurofascin-186, which are important for cell migration and adhesion in the CNS, mediate axonal injury (Mathey et al., 2007).

The accumulation of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory mediators exacerbate the immune response through the recruitment of naive microglia. Microglia are then activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and bind to the myelin-oligodendrocyte complex, previously opsonised with Fc fragments of antibodies and complement molecules. Microglial phagocytosis of the myelin sheath occurs upon surface-bound TNFα signal transduction (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) accumulate in the CNS further contributing to myelin and axon damage (Ortiz et al., 2014). While action potentials may depolarise demyelinated axon regions, conduction of these impulses occurs at reduced speeds (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

In progressive MS, demyelination coexists with diffuse neurodegeneration associated with the build-up of insoluble tau (Bartosik-Psujek &amp; Archelos, 2004). B lymphocyte infiltrates accumulate in the meninges, leading to intrathecal antibody production (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

What you basically need to understand is that a neuron has a voltage across its membrane at all times, that that voltage is due to a complex (im)balance of different ions.  When the neuron isn't doing anything, some current leaks across the membrane, but there are ""ion pumps"" that move all of the ions back to where they are supposed to be and maintain the cell's membrane voltage, sort of like pumping water uphill.  This potential difference is a source of potential energy, which the neuron can then translate into rapid fluctuations in membrane potential when required.

Now, here is the tricky thing:  Because so many parts of the neuron are so thin *AND* because the membrane is literally covered with various mechanisms that work to keep the membrane potential riht where it is, a change in membrane potential at *one* location in the neuron does not instantly cause a change in membrane potential throughout the rest of the neuron.  An influx of current into the cell can only alter the membrane voltage *locally*, because the influx of current won't make it very far down a dendrite or axon or what-have-you.  This is especially true because whatever event caused the influx of current is usually transient.

So, all that the opening of some neurotransmitter-gated channels at a synapse can really do is temporarily and locally make the membrane potential less negative.

UNLESS there are enough such events that they add up to enough to raise the membrane voltage from its resting state (-70 mV) to a magical threshold (usually around -55 mV).  If there's enough current coming in to raise the membrane potential (specifically, the membrane potential at the part of the cell body called the [axon hillock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Axon_Hillock.png) by those 15 millivolts, then something magical happens.

Special voltage-gated sodium channels are triggered when the voltage goes above -55 mV.  They allow huge influxes of current into the cell, which are strong enough to furhter raise the membrane voltage all the way up above zero, and actually make the inside of the cell temporarily *positive* (up to about +40 mV).  Then a bunch of other mechanisms take over and shoot the membrane potential back down belwo -70.  This part lasts under a millisecond.

But the amount of current that flows in during that millisecond is *just* enough to flow a ways down the axon, and raise the membrane voltage *in the first little stretch of the axon* up to the threshold of -55 mV.  So then there's a huge influx of sodium ions *there*.  And then that influxof current flows down the axon a little further, and triggers voltage gated sodium channels *there*, and so on.  

So there's a slightly more in-depth version.  At every single point along the entire cell's membrane, the membrane voltage of -70 millivolts is being tirelessly maintained.  Chemical signals from other cells can let in enough current to change the membrane voltage a little bit, locally.  But sometimes those signals add up to enough to raise the membrane voltage enough that it results in a (very brief) positive feedback loop, which lets in enough current to actually change the membrane voltage at *neighboring* spots on the membrane, which turns it into a chain reaction that can propagate all the way down the axon to the terminal.  And that's called an action potential.

Then at the terminal a bunch of other really complicated stuff happens.  Basically, current flowing into the terminal and changing the membrane voltage in the terminal causes the terminal to spit out gobs of neurotransmitter.  Which can then go help start the whole process over in another neuron.

Two guys compete for up to 12 rounds of 3 minutes each.  They're only allowed to punch (no kicks, knees, elbows, or wrestling holds) and can only hit above the belt.  They're given points by several judges based on how well they performed in each round - mostly landing punches or defending well.

You either win by the judges' points after 12 rounds, or by knocking the other guy down so that he can't get up in a 10-count, or by the referee or the other guy's team deciding that the guy can't safely fight anymore.

So now, as for this fight's importance.  Mayweather is considered by most to be the best boxer in the world - several titles, currently undefeated in his professional career.  Pacquio (who is Filipino) is also considered one of the best in the world - several titles over a long career.  But these two fighters have never gone against each other - ever since 2009, people have been hoping they'd fight, but they never managed to agree on payment, drug testing, etc until now.
